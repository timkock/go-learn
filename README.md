> “Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.” — Rob Pike

The main reasons for diving into go are

* concurrency and parallelism language features
* type safety and compiled code
* elegance in it's simplicity

### folders

* **gobyexample**
directory with steps from [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) a very insightful, simple and effective website to learn the core concepts of go.

* **concepts**
directory with proprietary implementations of code to test broad language encompassing concepts implemented in go.



### useful sites
Some gems found whilst learning golang:

* [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) awesome step by step with annotated code stubs.
* [memory usage](https://golangcode.com/print-the-current-memory-usage/) code explaining how to introspect memory usage.
* [go concurrency patterns](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#1) slide from golang about concurrency in go.
* [advanced go concurrency patterns](https://talks.golang.org/2013/advconc.slide#1) slide from golang about a more advanced implementation using concurrency.
